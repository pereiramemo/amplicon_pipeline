# Comments
All the pipelines are based on the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm implementation [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) tool. 

This tool is able to resolve Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), differing by as little as one nucleotide. 
ASVs provide biologically meaningful and consistent sequence labels, independently of reference databases. Also, ASVs provide a higher resolution of the taxonomic composition, compared to standard Operational Taxonomic Unit Clustering methods (Callahan 2017).
