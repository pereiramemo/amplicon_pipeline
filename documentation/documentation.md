# Comments
All the pipelines are based on the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm implementation [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) tool. 

This tool is able to resolve Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), differing by as little as one nucleotide. 
ASVs provide biologically meaningful and consistent sequence labels, independently of reference databases, and a higher resolution compared to standard Operational Taxonomic Unit Clustering methods (Callahan 2017).
